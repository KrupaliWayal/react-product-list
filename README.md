## 🛍 React Product List Filter

A beginner-friendly React project that displays a list of products with a real-time search filter. Built using functional components and hooks, this project helped strengthen understanding of component design, useState, event handling, and conditional rendering in React.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a responsive and interactive product listing using React. Users can:
- View a list of 15 products (hardcoded for simplicity)
- Filter the list by typing the product name into a search input
- View product name, description, and price displayed in a clean card layout

The filtering logic updates live as the user types and only shows matching products by name.
